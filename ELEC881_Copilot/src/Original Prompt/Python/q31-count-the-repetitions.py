'''
We define str = [s, n] as the string str which consists of the string s concatenated n times.

For example, str == ["abc", 3] =="abcabcabc".
We define that string s1 can be obtained from string s2 if we can remove some characters from s2 such that it becomes s1.

For example, s1 = "abc" can be obtained from s2 = "abdbec" based on our definition by removing the bolded underlined characters.
You are given two strings s1 and s2 and two integers n1 and n2. You have the two strings str1 = [s1, n1] and str2 = [s2, n2].

Return the maximum integer m such that str = [str2, m] can be obtained from str1.

 

Example 1:

Input: s1 = "acb", n1 = 4, s2 = "ab", n2 = 2
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: s1 = "acb", n1 = 1, s2 = "acb", n2 = 1
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100
s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.
1 <= n1, n2 <= 10^6
